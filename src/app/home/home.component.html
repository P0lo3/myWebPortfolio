        <h2>My Overview</h2>
        <p>
            With twelve years of experience as a network engineer specializing in layers 1 to 3 of the OSI model, I have developed a deep understanding in network configuration and troubleshooting. Recently, I embarked on a new journey towards becoming a full-stack developer. To support this transition, I have enrolled myself in a comprehensive academic program and engaged in various learning resources, including books and online courses. My goal is to integrate my extensive IT background with new programming skills to contribute effectively to software development projects.
